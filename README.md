# SecureRand-rs

## Description

**SecureRand-rs** is an easy to use crate for generating cryptographic randomness in different instances.

## Instance 1: The Password-Derived Randomness With External Input From The Operating System

The first implemented instance uses `argon2` and `rand_chacha`. It takes as input a password (UTF-8) and generates a cryptographic salt using the operating system, deriving a seed from the well trusted argon2 password hashing function.

It then inputs the 32-byte seed into `ChaCha20RNG` to generate cryptographic randomness.

**Note: Due to the salt being generated by the operating system, you can not use the same password to derive the same secret. In the future, this will be added.**

### Usage

```rust
use securerand_rs::securerand::SecureRandom;

fn main() {
    // Password for Argon2id
    let password: &str = "SecureRandPassword123";

    // SecureRandom Usage (Instance 1) using Argon2id, OS-CSPRNG Salt, and seeded into ChaCha20RNG. This password uses a generated salt so each time will be different.
    let csprng_bytes: [u8;32] = SecureRandom::new(password);
}
```

## TODO (or contributions):

- Add Password-Derived Determeninistic CSPRNG.
- Add BIP39
- Add Output of More Bytes
- Add VRF
- Add Errors
